    "description": "Ghanaian startup Liquify, a digital invoice finance platform for African SME exporters who are stuck waiting 30-90 days to get paid, has raised an oversubscribed US$1.5 million seed round of funding to close the $120bn African trade finance gap.Liquifyis an invoice financing marketplace that connects African SMEs with global capital markets, turning export invoices into rapid, affordable working capital. Its end-to-end digital platform automates onboarding, KYC/AML, credit checks, and settlement – enabling exporters to get paid within hours and investors to access short-term, low-correlation assets.“We unlock cash trapped in their unpaid invoices: exporters upload an invoice, our platform runs KYC/AML and credit checks, and the invoices get funded within hours, not weeks, at a fraction of the cost,” Nadya Yaremenko, who founded Liquify alongside Alberta Asafo-Asamoah in 2023,told Disrupt Africa last month.Since its beta launch in late 2024, Liquify has facilitated over 150 transactions, totaling US$4 million in trade financed. The startup has now raised US$1.5 million in equity seed funding to help expand across Sub-Saharan Africa. The round was led by Future Africa with participation from Launch Africa, 54 Collective, Digital Africa and Equitable Ventures, alongside several strategic angel investors.In addition, Emerald Africa extended its debt facility, bolstering Liquify’s liquidity and flexibility for supporting its expanding SME customer base.With this financing, Liquify will scale its Ghanaian hub, hiring across product, technology, and customer-success teams to support rapid platform growth, and expand into Anglophone and Francophone markets. It also plans to accelerate product innovation, enhancing its AI-driven due-diligence, KYC/AML, and credit-scoring engines.“We built Liquify to unlock the $120 billion trade-finance gap holding back Africa’s most dynamic SMEs,” Yaremenko said. “This seed round – as well the incredible people joining our team – validates our vision. With our fully digital, AI-powered platform, exporters can turn unpaid invoices into same-day cash, while global investors gain access to a new untapped class.”",

    "description": "ShareGrants and loans should be lifelines for small businesses,but for many Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Africa, they’ve become sources of constant frustration.You’ve probably heard this before:“We regret to inform you that your application was not successful…”Sound familiar? You’re not alone, and it’s not always your fault.❗The Real Reasons MSMEs Keep Missing Out on GrantsMost times, the problem isn’t your business idea. The problem is what funders don’t see in your application. Here’s where it often goes wrong:1.Poor DocumentationNo up-to-date financial records, no business plan, no CAC registration? Funders see that as a red flag. They need proof that your business is structured, real, and reliable.2.Wrong-Fit ApplicationsMany MSMEs apply for grants outside their eligibility, wrong sector, wrong location, or wrong stage of business growth. It’s like wearing the wrong size shoes: uncomfortable and unworkable.3.Unclear Business ModelIf you can’t clearly explain what you do, who you serve, and how you’ll use the funds, it’s hard for anyone to trust you with money.4.No Evidence of ImpactGrants often go to businesses solving real problems. If you can’t show that your business is making a difference or gaining traction, you’ll lose out.5.Ignoring InstructionsIt sounds basic, but many applicants get disqualified for missing deadlines, skipping questions, or uploading the wrong documents.💰Why MSMEs Also Miss Out on LoansGrants are hard, yes. But loans? That’s another beast entirely. Here’s why banks and microfinance lenders often say “no”:1.No Credit History or CollateralLenders want security. If you’ve never borrowed before or can’t offer collateral, they consider it a risky deal.2.Weak Cash FlowEven with a registered business, if your numbers don’t show that you can repay monthly, it’s game over.3.Incomplete ApplicationsMissing documents, unsigned forms, or unclear business purpose? Your file may not even make it past the first review.4.Lack of Business ComplianceIf your business isn’t registered or doesn’t pay taxes, banks will assume you’re not serious, or worse, you’re hiding something.What You Can Do InsteadThe goal isn’t just to apply, it’s to qualify. Here’s how to shift from “rejected” to “approved“:✅ Register and structure your business legally (CAC, TIN, SCUML, etc.)✅ Track your income and expenses. Prepare simple monthly financial reports.✅ Define your business model,clearly and confidently.✅ Build relationships with banks, grant managers, and business development centers.✅ Invest in training, grant and loan applications are a skill.✅ Join communities (likeMSME Africa Community group) to learn, grow, and get support.Post Views:96ShareRelated Posts:Ultimate 2025 Guide to the Top Business Enabling…MSME Africa Unveils Top 50 Remarkable MSME Founders…Overcoming Binding Constraints to Competitive…15 Social Media Management Tools That Will Make Life…How African Startups Can Secure Funding in Tough MarketsMallpai Foundation: A Beacon of Hope for the VulnerableTags:AccessToFundingBusinessGrowthEntrepreneurshipInAfricaFinancialLiteracyFundingOpportunitiesGrantsForMSMEsLoanSupportMSMEafricaSmallBusinessTipsSMEFinance",

    "description": "We are pleased to announce the winners of the OD Impact Challenge 2021. Thank you to all applicants for a most exciting competition season and commend you for your hard work. Your passion, optimism and commitment to solve the world’s most pressing problems is an inspiration to everyone around the world.Selecting the top three was a very tough decision to make as all finalists were outstanding. They represent leaders and entrepreneurs who are taking great steps to solve real problems and add significant value to the lives of people in the communities. It is amazing to see the brilliant ideas and we are deeply moved by the commitment of young people to bringing about positive change in your community.Meet the Winners______________________________________________________________________________#1 First Place: Stanley Anigbogu ( Nigeria)- CEO & Founder, ArtechubsStanley Anigbogu is the founder of ArtecHubs Nigeria, which is a leading tech skill acquisition company for young minds in southeastern Nigeria.According to Stanley, well-intentioned mandatory education laws have put a strain on education in primary & secondary schools. As employers struggle to hire, they’ve added unrealistic qualifications & credentials to even the least entry-level jobs making it even harder for people without an education pedigree to find quality jobs. This inspired Stanley to create ArtecHubs; to equip young persons irrespective of financial capability or social strata for the future workforce either as start-up founders or employees with quality pay.ArtecHubs prepares young persons for the fourth industrial revolution and challenges them to become job creators rather than job seekers by equipping them with relevant skills needed for the future workforce and providing support systems for their growing start-ups. Unlike other skill acquisition companies /STEM hubs, ArtecHubs treats students inrural communities with utmost priority given the fear they have that they may not be able to withstand the competition from their folks who grew up in the urban areas with access to facilities like theirs. These do this through hands-on inclusive training sessions, Industry 4.0 boot camps, and group community projects/exhibitions.#2 Second Place: Muhammad Iqhrammullah ( Indonesia)- Co-Leader, Co-EXAMPLE/Chemistry Department, UNSYIAHMuhammad Iqhrammullah is one of leading young scientists in Indonesia whose works cover various research topics in sustainability; ranging from heavy metal to citizen science.

His method offers a shortcut to the manufacturing of the material as it does not require polyol extraction. The polymeric materials he has prepared are used to control and monitor the heavy metal contamination in the water by using adsorptive removal and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy techniques, respectively.He is a part of a team, formerly led by Prof. Dr. Ir. Marlina, M.Si, that received a grant from WWF Netherlands to conduct a citizen science project in Aceh Jaya Regency, Aceh Province, Indonesia. The project has been conducted for more than a year with an objective to empower the community in combating the mercury pollution. The area was infamous for the threat of mercury pollution released from the artisanal gold mining. The citizen science project helps the community to be aware of the dangers of mercury, by involving them in the pollution assessment.

I have also attended a lot of seminars and workshops through the opportunities shared by Opportunity Desk. Early 2020, we saw an opportunity on Opportunity Desk to apply for Global Giving. We did andparticipated in the acceleration program and received over $100 to make reusable cloth pads for women in the vulnerable situation; IDP Camp.More recently, I applied for Leap Africa program through Opportunity Desk and was selected.”-Ngunan Ioron AlohoI found opportunity desk for the first time in 2017 when I was still home, looking for undergraduate scholarships so that I can further to university. Since then, I have been an ardent follower and user of the platform. I dream big, A LOT but most times, my immediate situation and environment always manage to shut my dreams down knowing that there’s no way I can afford things that I desire. However, opportunity desk represented the window out, a promise of the future for me. With numerous global opportunities to apply for and seeing testimonies of previous users, my hope began to build but with three years of consistent rejections, it was draining However in 2020, I had some close call to acceptances; finalist in One Young World Enterprise for peace scholarship, finalist for G(girls)20 to represent African Union, alternate selection for the Hanson Leadership Institute in San Diego and finally got selected to represent Nigeria at the Miss Career Africa 2020 Competition in Rwanda where I won the Miss Speaker Africa 2020 title. It was my first time travelling outside the country in a plane and the genesis of me launching my Forbidden Topics business. It took me three years to get this far. I learnt consistency, perseverance and global thinking via the platform and I am grateful to Opportunity desk for that. I always introduce young people to the platform every time I get speaking opportunities so that the cake can go round after all, the sky is big enough for all birds to fly.”– Oluwadamilola AkinteweWe are proud of every applicant.
