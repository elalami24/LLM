It aims to reshape their participation in the delivery of humanitarian work by ensuring they take centre stage in the decisions affecting their lives, leading the identification of needs and the design of innovative solutions.The Fund provides holistic support – combining financial resources, mentoring, and other expertise – directly to organizations led by forcibly displaced and stateless people, to enable them to design and deliver new interventions that have a lasting positive impact on their communities.RequirementsThe Fund supports innovation by all organizations led by people with lived experience of forced displacement or statelessness – including refugees, asylum-seekers, the internally displaced, returnees, and stateless people – that are recognized within their communities due to their past significant contributions.Applicants are required to apply as a team, representing an existing organization made up of multiple community members. Organizations must demonstrate a collective structure to qualify. Individual applicants are not eligible.The Fund accepts applications fromboth registered and unregistered organizationsthat are well known in their communities due to their past significant contributions and initiatives.Additional attention will be given to ensuring organizations led by LGBTIQ+ persons, women, people with disabilities, internally displaced and stateless individuals, Indigenous populations, and other underrepresented groups receive support and encouragement to apply to the Fund.BenefitsSelected organizations can expect the following:Financial support:Organizations can apply for up to 45,000 USD (equivalent in local currency) in funding to test and implement ideas with strong community-based approaches that generate value for community members, not specifically linked to any thematic area or technology.Programme and project management support:Supported organizations will receive assistance from UNHCR and experts to help build their capacity to design and implement programmes effectively.Technical support and expertise:Needs-based specialist advice will be offered, on topics ranging from technology to legal support and innovation methodologies.Peer-to-peer networking:Supported organizations will be encouraged to engage with each other, share experiences, learn from each other, and explore partnerships.An emphasis on learning:Support will be provided to enable supported organizations to measure outcomes, assess their progress, and gather information to support growth. They will be encouraged to document, share, and make use of relevant learnings. Discussion and reflection with their communities will enable them to incorporate and respond to feedback.Other support, based on project needs, could include organizational support, help with project sustainability and scale, training on specific topics, business model advice, and media and communications support.How to applyEach year, we launch a new call for applications inviting organizations to submit a proposal throughthis online platform. In their proposal, organizations should outline the challenge they aim to address, their proposed solution, a budget, and the changes they expect to see in their communities as a result of their project.In 2025, applications are open until August 22.These proposals go through a four-phase selection process:1) Proposal longlisting:The Innovation Service reviews all submissions and identifies a longlist of promising applications.2) Vetting and due diligence:Longlisted organizations undergo a thorough vetting and due diligence process to confirm their eligibility. Part of this process involves verifying that each organization’s leadership comprises at least 50% individuals with lived experience of forced displacement or statelessness. Supporting documentation must be provided to verify this. Failure to meet this requirement or to provide the necessary documentation will result in disqualification from the application process.3) Pitch your idea:Organizations that pass the vetting and due diligence process will be invited to pitch their ideas to a selection committee composed of members of the UNHCR Innovation Service, as well as representatives from the relevant UNHCR Country Operations and Regional Bureaus. This is an opportunity for organizations to expand on their submitted proposal and engage in a conversation about their idea. Organizations that successfully defend their idea will be shortlisted and move to the final phase of the selection process.4) Final selection:Shortlisted proposals are reviewed by the Fund’s Steering Committee, which is composed of forcibly displaced and stateless individuals, representatives of relevant UNHCR units at the global level, and, where feasible, donor representatives. The Steering Committee will select the most promising ideas to be endorsed by the Fund.For More Information:Visit the Official Webpage of the UNHCR Refugee-led Innovation Fund",

It aims to reshape their participation in the delivery of humanitarian work by ensuring they take centre stage in the decisions affecting their lives, leading the identification of needs and the design of innovative solutions.The Fund provides holistic support – combining financial resources, mentoring, and other expertise – directly to organizations led by forcibly displaced and stateless people, to enable them to design and deliver new interventions that have a lasting positive impact on their communities.RequirementsThe Fund supports innovation by all organizations led by people with lived experience of forced displacement or statelessness – including refugees, asylum-seekers, the internally displaced, returnees, and stateless people – that are recognized within their communities due to their past significant contributions.Applicants are required to apply as a team, representing an existing organization made up of multiple community members. Organizations must demonstrate a collective structure to qualify. Individual applicants are not eligible.The Fund accepts applications fromboth registered and unregistered organizationsthat are well known in their communities due to their past significant contributions and initiatives.Additional attention will be given to ensuring organizations led by LGBTIQ+ persons, women, people with disabilities, internally displaced and stateless individuals, Indigenous populations, and other underrepresented groups receive support and encouragement to apply to the Fund.BenefitsSelected organizations can expect the following:Financial support:Organizations can apply for up to 45,000 USD (equivalent in local currency) in funding to test and implement ideas with strong community-based approaches that generate value for community members, not specifically linked to any thematic area or technology.Programme and project management support:Supported organizations will receive assistance from UNHCR and experts to help build their capacity to design and implement programmes effectively.Technical support and expertise:Needs-based specialist advice will be offered, on topics ranging from technology to legal support and innovation methodologies.Peer-to-peer networking:Supported organizations will be encouraged to engage with each other, share experiences, learn from each other, and explore partnerships.An emphasis on learning:Support will be provided to enable supported organizations to measure outcomes, assess their progress, and gather information to support growth. They will be encouraged to document, share, and make use of relevant learnings. Discussion and reflection with their communities will enable them to incorporate and respond to feedback.Other support, based on project needs, could include organizational support, help with project sustainability and scale, training on specific topics, business model advice, and media and communications support.How to applyEach year, we launch a new call for applications inviting organizations to submit a proposal throughthis online platform. In their proposal, organizations should outline the challenge they aim to address, their proposed solution, a budget, and the changes they expect to see in their communities as a result of their project.In 2025, applications are open until August 22.These proposals go through a four-phase selection process:1) Proposal longlisting:The Innovation Service reviews all submissions and identifies a longlist of promising applications.2) Vetting and due diligence:Longlisted organizations undergo a thorough vetting and due diligence process to confirm their eligibility. Part of this process involves verifying that each organization’s leadership comprises at least 50% individuals with lived experience of forced displacement or statelessness. Supporting documentation must be provided to verify this. Failure to meet this requirement or to provide the necessary documentation will result in disqualification from the application process.3) Pitch your idea:Organizations that pass the vetting and due diligence process will be invited to pitch their ideas to a selection committee composed of members of the UNHCR Innovation Service, as well as representatives from the relevant UNHCR Country Operations and Regional Bureaus. This is an opportunity for organizations to expand on their submitted proposal and engage in a conversation about their idea. Organizations that successfully defend their idea will be shortlisted and move to the final phase of the selection process.4) Final selection:Shortlisted proposals are reviewed by the Fund’s Steering Committee, which is composed of forcibly displaced and stateless individuals, representatives of relevant UNHCR units at the global level, and, where feasible, donor representatives. The Steering Committee will select the most promising ideas to be endorsed by the Fund.For More Information:Visit the Official Webpage of the UNHCR Refugee-led Innovation Fund",

It aims to reshape their participation in the delivery of humanitarian work by ensuring they take centre stage in the decisions affecting their lives, leading the identification of needs and the design of innovative solutions.The Fund provides holistic support – combining financial resources, mentoring, and other expertise – directly to organizations led by forcibly displaced and stateless people, to enable them to design and deliver new interventions that have a lasting positive impact on their communities.RequirementsThe Fund supports innovation by all organizations led by people with lived experience of forced displacement or statelessness – including refugees, asylum-seekers, the internally displaced, returnees, and stateless people – that are recognized within their communities due to their past significant contributions.Applicants are required to apply as a team, representing an existing organization made up of multiple community members. Organizations must demonstrate a collective structure to qualify. Individual applicants are not eligible.The Fund accepts applications fromboth registered and unregistered organizationsthat are well known in their communities due to their past significant contributions and initiatives.Additional attention will be given to ensuring organizations led by LGBTIQ+ persons, women, people with disabilities, internally displaced and stateless individuals, Indigenous populations, and other underrepresented groups receive support and encouragement to apply to the Fund.BenefitsSelected organizations can expect the following:Financial support:Organizations can apply for up to 45,000 USD (equivalent in local currency) in funding to test and implement ideas with strong community-based approaches that generate value for community members, not specifically linked to any thematic area or technology.Programme and project management support:Supported organizations will receive assistance from UNHCR and experts to help build their capacity to design and implement programmes effectively.Technical support and expertise:Needs-based specialist advice will be offered, on topics ranging from technology to legal support and innovation methodologies.Peer-to-peer networking:Supported organizations will be encouraged to engage with each other, share experiences, learn from each other, and explore partnerships.An emphasis on learning:Support will be provided to enable supported organizations to measure outcomes, assess their progress, and gather information to support growth. They will be encouraged to document, share, and make use of relevant learnings. Discussion and reflection with their communities will enable them to incorporate and respond to feedback.Other support, based on project needs, could include organizational support, help with project sustainability and scale, training on specific topics, business model advice, and media and communications support.How to applyEach year, we launch a new call for applications inviting organizations to submit a proposal throughthis online platform. In their proposal, organizations should outline the challenge they aim to address, their proposed solution, a budget, and the changes they expect to see in their communities as a result of their project.In 2025, applications are open until August 22.These proposals go through a four-phase selection process:1) Proposal longlisting:The Innovation Service reviews all submissions and identifies a longlist of promising applications.2) Vetting and due diligence:Longlisted organizations undergo a thorough vetting and due diligence process to confirm their eligibility. Part of this process involves verifying that each organization’s leadership comprises at least 50% individuals with lived experience of forced displacement or statelessness. Supporting documentation must be provided to verify this. Failure to meet this requirement or to provide the necessary documentation will result in disqualification from the application process.3) Pitch your idea:Organizations that pass the vetting and due diligence process will be invited to pitch their ideas to a selection committee composed of members of the UNHCR Innovation Service, as well as representatives from the relevant UNHCR Country Operations and Regional Bureaus. This is an opportunity for organizations to expand on their submitted proposal and engage in a conversation about their idea. Organizations that successfully defend their idea will be shortlisted and move to the final phase of the selection process.4) Final selection:Shortlisted proposals are reviewed by the Fund’s Steering Committee, which is composed of forcibly displaced and stateless individuals, representatives of relevant UNHCR units at the global level, and, where feasible, donor representatives. The Steering Committee will select the most promising ideas to be endorsed by the Fund.For More Information:Visit the Official Webpage of the UNHCR Refugee-led Innovation Fund",

    "content": "ShareThe Ekiti State Government has officially kicked off the Nigeria for Women Program Scale-Up (NFWP-SU), a World Bank-supported initiative aimed at creating sustainable economic opportunities for women, starting with three local government areas. The program represents a major milestone in advancing women’s empowerment and inclusive development at the grassroots level.Speaking at the official launch, the Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Mrs. Olapeju Babafemi, described the initiative as a bold commitment by Governor Abayomi Oyebanji’s administration to improve women’s livelihoods and economic independence.“This program represents a significant step in empowering women economically at the grassroots level. The administration’s investment in the program is a testament to its commitment to improving women’s livelihood and economic independence. The vision of the program is to engender an inclusive and economically vibrant society where women are empowered to thrive,” Babafemi stated.The program’s first phase will be implemented inEfon, Moba, and Gbonyin/Ayekire LGAs, with expansion planned as the initiative progresses. The NFWP-SU is designed to encourage teamwork, promote financial literacy, strengthen women’s savings culture, and build social cohesion among rural women. It also aims to raise the overall quality of life for women and their families.Babafemi also acknowledged the contributions of the First Lady, Dr. Olayemi Oyebanji, in supporting the program’s rollout across the state, and urged women to participate actively by formingWomen Affinity Groups (WAGs)and adhering to program guidelines.To facilitate successful implementation, theState Project Coordinating Unit (SPCU), led by State Project CoordinatorMrs. Toyin Familoni, began stakeholder engagement in Efon LGA. The team paid courtesy visits to local traditional rulers, chiefs, the LGA chairman, and other council officials as part of early groundwork.Familoni noted, “The visits were part of strategies designed to seek community buy-in and create an enabling environment for effective implementation.”She further announced the commencement of theParticipatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) Exercise, which includes stakeholder mapping, sensitization campaigns, and the identification of ward facilitators. “These are crucial steps to ensure that the intervention fits the actual requirements of the women in the community and achieves maximum impact,” she said.The program also aims to provide access to finance through structured group formations, helping participants build financial literacy and economic resilience. According to Familoni, the response from Efon stakeholders has been highly encouraging, with many leaders optimistic about the program’s potential to transform the socio-economic landscape for women.“Reactions from community leaders and stakeholders in Efon have been very encouraging. There is a strong sense of optimism that the Nigeria for Women Programme will truly bring about long-term benefits for the women involved,” she added.She confirmed that implementation inMoba and Ayekire LGAswill begin soon as part of the first-phase rollout.The Nigeria for Women Program Scale-Up (NFWP-SU) in Ekiti State is a joint effort by theFederal Ministry of Women Affairs, theEkiti State Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, and theWorld Bank, aimed at reducing poverty and gender inequality through economic empowerment.Post Views:47ShareRelated Posts:Ultimate 2025 Guide to the Top Business Enabling…MSME Africa Unveils Top 50 Remarkable MSME Founders…15 Social Media Management Tools That Will Make Life…International Breweries’ Kickstart Initiative Awards…Ekiti Business Owners Get FG’s N150,000 Grant Each…Ekiti State Governor Implements Comprehensive…Tags:Ekiti StateNFWP-SUNigeria for Women Program Scale UpWorld Bank-Backed Women Empowerment Program",

    "content": "Deadline: August 31, 2025Proposals are invited for theIFAD Somalia Womenâs Market Access Innovation Challenge 2025. The Open Innovation Challenge is a pivotal initiative designed to enhance agricultural innovation and empower entrepreneurs in Somalia to bring ideas to solve the challenges Somali women farmers face in accessing markets.Women in rural Somalia play a crucial role in agriculture but face significant barriers to market access due to inadequate infrastructure, limited financial resources, limited access to agricultural land, systemic challenges, and cultural constraints. These challenges restrict their economic participation, limiting opportunities for women-led agrobusinesses to scale and thrive. Additionally, women entrepreneurs struggle with access to financing, business development services, and digital financial tools, further widening the gender gap in economic empowerment.To address these challenges, the Rural Livelihoods Resilience Programme (RLRP) and the Somalia Food Systems Resilience Project (S-FSRP), implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MoAI) with support respectively from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and World Bank Group, are committed to strengthening womenâs economic participation through entrepreneurship, financial inclusion, and innovative solutions. This includes improving access to credit, enhancing market linkages, and providing capacity-building initiatives to equip women with the skills needed to grow their businesses and adapt to market demands. The program also leverages digital financial services to increase financial accessibility for women, even those without internet access, while fostering community engagement and policy advocacy to create an inclusive economic environment.BenefitsSelected entrepreneurs will receive tailored business coaching, seed funding for product development, support in market access, and networking opportunities. ÂEligibilityThis open innovation challenge calls for proposals from legally registered, rural women-led enterprises, as well as businesses with at least 30 per cent women in their leadership team.Interested applicants should have a scalable solution, as well as a validated technological prototype to address the problem they are proposing to solve.The proposal should seek to achieve one or more of the following outcomes: enhance womenâs access to agricultural markets; improve the competitiveness of women-led agribusinesses; and establish sustainable market linkages through innovation and technology and promote financial inclusion.ApplicationThe deadline for submission is August 31, 2025 at 5:00 PM Mogadishu time.Click here to applyFor more information, visitSomalia Womenâs Market Access Innovation Challenge.",
