The programme, now in its third edition, then seeks to provide these companies with business coaching, access to engineering consultation for product development, and guidance on protecting intellectual property. After receiving 435 applications from 19 countries, Qualcomm has now named the 10 selected ventures for the 2025 Make in Africa programme. Three of the selected companies are from Kenya, namely Farmer Lifeline, which builds solar AI robots for crop disease detection; Pollen Patrollers, an AI-driven pollination support tech; and Solar Freeze, which develops IoT-powered cold storage for food preservation. Another three hail from Tunisia, in the shape of AmalXR, which does virtual reality rehabilitation with AI progress tracking; Ecobees, which develops smart beekeeping tech with AI monitoring; and Pixii Motors, an AI/IoT-enhanced electric scooter ecosystem. Completing the cohort are two Nigerian ventures – AI-based drug discovery platform Aframend and hyperlocal flood risk AI prediction tool ClimatrixAI – as well as Benin-based IoT solar pisciculture automation service Archeos and Senegalese AI-based mobile liver fibrosis detection tool Edulytics. These startups will receive technical mentorship, business coaching, access to Qualcomm hardware, and IP training. One startup will also be awarded the Qualcomm Wireless Reach Social Impact Fund to scale its solution.",
