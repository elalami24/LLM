With offices in Cape Town, London, and Jersey, Knife Capital invests through KNF I, KNF II, and Knife Fund III, and to mark its 15th birthday it has announced investments in two South African startups via KNF II.

By streamlining all school-related transactions into a simple, digital platform, Sticitt, which was first backed by Knife via its Grindstone accelerator and Grindstone Ventures, currently serves 841 schools and supports over 75,700 users. “Knife, with their strong track record of supporting the growth of their portfolio companies, is the perfect shareholder to help Sticitt through the next phase of the business’ growth journey,” said Theo Kitshoff, CEO and founder of Sticitt. “Their experience and extensive networks locally and abroad will play a vital role in helping Sticitt achieve significance and sustainability in supporting schools to operate more sustainably, whilst equipping future generations with healthy financial habits. ”Optique, meanwhile, was founded in 2017, and is redefining optometry with a simple idea – eyecare should be digitally-enabled, affordable, accessible, and easy to understand. With 19 franchise-owned branches across South Africa and an online store, the company’s offering is disrupting the traditional model. “Optique has always been about redefining eyecare accessibility through an innovative business model that blends technology, affordability, and convenience. This investment from Knife Capital is a pivotal step in accelerating our growth, expanding our footprint, and ensuring that more people have access to world-class optometry services,” said Optique founder Leon van Vuuren. Keet van Zyl, co-founder and partner at Knife Capital, said his company’s focus had always been on backing entrepreneurs who execute with “purpose and clarity”. “Both Sticitt and Optique are solving real-world problems in bold ways, whether it’s digitising school payments or delivering innovative, digitally-enabled vision solutions.

    "description": "Ghanaian startup Liquify, a digital invoice finance platform for African SME exporters who are stuck waiting 30-90 days to get paid, has raised an oversubscribed US$1. 5 million seed round of funding to close the $120bn African trade finance gap. Liquifyis an invoice financing marketplace that connects African SMEs with global capital markets, turning export invoices into rapid, affordable working capital. Its end-to-end digital platform automates onboarding, KYC/AML, credit checks, and settlement – enabling exporters to get paid within hours and investors to access short-term, low-correlation assets. “We unlock cash trapped in their unpaid invoices: exporters upload an invoice, our platform runs KYC/AML and credit checks, and the invoices get funded within hours, not weeks, at a fraction of the cost,” Nadya Yaremenko, who founded Liquify alongside Alberta Asafo-Asamoah in 2023,told Disrupt Africa last month. Since its beta launch in late 2024, Liquify has facilitated over 150 transactions, totaling US$4 million in trade financed. The startup has now raised US$1. 5 million in equity seed funding to help expand across Sub-Saharan Africa. The round was led by Future Africa with participation from Launch Africa, 54 Collective, Digital Africa and Equitable Ventures, alongside several strategic angel investors. In addition, Emerald Africa extended its debt facility, bolstering Liquify’s liquidity and flexibility for supporting its expanding SME customer base. With this financing, Liquify will scale its Ghanaian hub, hiring across product, technology, and customer-success teams to support rapid platform growth, and expand into Anglophone and Francophone markets. It also plans to accelerate product innovation, enhancing its AI-driven due-diligence, KYC/AML, and credit-scoring engines. “We built Liquify to unlock the $120 billion trade-finance gap holding back Africa’s most dynamic SMEs,” Yaremenko said. “This seed round – as well the incredible people joining our team – validates our vision. With our fully digital, AI-powered platform, exporters can turn unpaid invoices into same-day cash, while global investors gain access to a new untapped class. ” Processed with VSCO with q9 presetGhanaian invoice financing startup Liquify raises oversubscribed $1. 5m seed round0ByTom JacksononJuly 2, 2025News,West AfricaGhanaian startup Liquify, a digital invoice finance platform for African SME exporters who are stuck waiting 30-90 days to get paid, has raised an oversubscribed US$1. ” Tom JacksonWebsiteX (Twitter)LinkedInPassionate about the vibrant tech startups scene in Africa, Tom can usually be found sniffing out the continent's most exciting new companies and entrepreneurs, funding rounds and any other developments within the growing ecosystem.

    "description": "Nigerian e-commerce startup Shoptreo has secured an undisclosed round of funding to help take local artisan products global. Shoptreois unlocking value in informal markets and underserved production ecosystems like the Aba Artisanal Leather Cluster – one of Africa’s largest hubs for handcrafted leather goods – by equipping artisans with digital storefronts, integrated logistics, payments, and inventory tools to efficiently meet global demand. Beyond marketplace support, it offers strategic inventory financing to trusted distributors and bulk buyers, enabling them to scale, fulfill large orders, and overcome cash flow bottlenecks. By blending fintech innovation with grassroots manufacturing, Shoptreo is shaping the future of African commerce. The startup has now raised funding from Rebel Seed Capital, \\which targets early-stage founders with ticket sizes ranging from US$10,000 to US$50,000. “Rebel Seed Capital’s vision aligns with Shoptreo’s goal of driving value at underrepresented segments. The funding will help us continue our expansion drive while taking Aba Leather products global,” said George Uteh, founder and CEO of Shoptreo. With this investment, Shoptreo plans to double down on product development, onboard hundreds of new artisans, and deepen integration with logistics and financial service providers to ensure seamless order fulfillment and cross-border commerce. “The Aba Artisanal Leather Clusters represent a major economic and commercial opportunity which, if properly harnessed through digital transformation, will unlock wealth and prosperity at an insane level. The Shoptreo team has demonstrated enough hunger, drive, and execution, which we believe are the right combination of attributes required to win,” said Emeka Okoye, managing partner at Rebel Seed Capital.

The redesign of its flagship programme is built to prepare Africa’s most promising tech talents to build, launch, and scale world-class AI startups. “Africa has world-class tech talent, and it’s time AI solutions built on the continent reach users everywhere,” said Emily Fiagbedzi, director of the MEST AI Startup Programme. “MEST is proud to contribute to this reality through our training and incubation programme that equips talent from across Africa with training and mentoring from international experts for the development of globally relevant AI software. ”The MEST AI Startup Programme is a fully-funded, immersive experience hosted in Accra, Ghana, which equips Africa’s most promising AI entrepreneurs with the technical, business, and leadership skills to build and scale globally competitive startups. Over an intensive seven-month training phase, founders receive hands-on instruction, technical mentorship, and business coaching from global experts while developing AI-powered solutions to real-world challenges. The top ventures then advance to a four-month incubation period, where they refine their products, secure market traction, and sharpen their go-to-market strategies. At the end of incubation, startups have an opportunity to pitch for pre-seed investment of up to US$100, 000 and join the MEST portfolio. “Mastering AI and the advanced AI tools available today is a must for any entrepreneur and further levelling the playing field. The world has never been flatter. We are proud and excited to announce that the next batch of MEST entrepreneurs will be trained by some of the most knowledgeable people in the industry from companies such as OpenAI, Perplexity, Google, and Meltwater,” said MEST founder Jorn Lyseggen. For the 2026 intake, the programme is open to African founders based in West Africa aged 21 – 30 with software development experience who want to start their own AI startup.

    "description": "Ghanaian startup Liquify, a digital invoice finance platform for African SME exporters who are stuck waiting 30-90 days to get paid, has raised an oversubscribed US$1. 5 million seed round of funding to close the $120bn African trade finance gap. Liquifyis an invoice financing marketplace that connects African SMEs with global capital markets, turning export invoices into rapid, affordable working capital. Its end-to-end digital platform automates onboarding, KYC/AML, credit checks, and settlement – enabling exporters to get paid within hours and investors to access short-term, low-correlation assets. “We unlock cash trapped in their unpaid invoices: exporters upload an invoice, our platform runs KYC/AML and credit checks, and the invoices get funded within hours, not weeks, at a fraction of the cost,” Nadya Yaremenko, who founded Liquify alongside Alberta Asafo-Asamoah in 2023,told Disrupt Africa last month. Since its beta launch in late 2024, Liquify has facilitated over 150 transactions, totaling US$4 million in trade financed. The startup has now raised US$1. 5 million in equity seed funding to help expand across Sub-Saharan Africa. The round was led by Future Africa with participation from Launch Africa, 54 Collective, Digital Africa and Equitable Ventures, alongside several strategic angel investors. In addition, Emerald Africa extended its debt facility, bolstering Liquify’s liquidity and flexibility for supporting its expanding SME customer base. With this financing, Liquify will scale its Ghanaian hub, hiring across product, technology, and customer-success teams to support rapid platform growth, and expand into Anglophone and Francophone markets. It also plans to accelerate product innovation, enhancing its AI-driven due-diligence, KYC/AML, and credit-scoring engines. “We built Liquify to unlock the $120 billion trade-finance gap holding back Africa’s most dynamic SMEs,” Yaremenko said. “This seed round – as well the incredible people joining our team – validates our vision. With our fully digital, AI-powered platform, exporters can turn unpaid invoices into same-day cash, while global investors gain access to a new untapped class. ” Processed with VSCO with q9 presetGhanaian invoice financing startup Liquify raises oversubscribed $1. 5m seed round0ByTom JacksononJuly 2, 2025News,West AfricaGhanaian startup Liquify, a digital invoice finance platform for African SME exporters who are stuck waiting 30-90 days to get paid, has raised an oversubscribed US$1. ” Tom JacksonWebsiteX (Twitter)LinkedInPassionate about the vibrant tech startups scene in Africa, Tom can usually be found sniffing out the continent's most exciting new companies and entrepreneurs, funding rounds and any other developments within the growing ecosystem.

    "description": "732Application Deadline: 04 August 2025. Applications are now open for theCall for Youth Delegation to the World Forum for Democracy. The World Forum for Democracy is a unique platform for political decision-makers and activists to debate solutions to key challenges for democracies worldwide. The theme of the 2025 edition of the World Forum for Democracy is“Democracy at risk: how can we revive it?”The 2025 edition of the World Forum for Democracy will address how the lack of trust in democratic institutions and processes undermines democratic legitimacy, stability, and resilience to both external and internal threats. When citizens are no longer invested in democracy, they may gradually withdraw from voting and other forms of civic participation, leaving the fundamental freedoms that underpin democratic institutions increasingly vulnerable. This vulnerability creates an environment in which populists and autocrats have greater latitude to weaken institutional checks and balances, undermine constitutional protections, and restrict freedoms such as expression and association. Organised on an annual basis, the programme of the Forum features inspirational talks bythought leaders. Breakaway sessions and creative workshops will challenge proposed newsolutions and identify ideas worth spreading. Moreover, the Forum will actively foster the creationof networks and communities of practice, serving as incubators for turning ideas into action. The participants of the youth delegation will gather at the European Youth centre in Strasbourgtwo days before the start of the Forum to learn about the Council of Europe and its work withyouth, to get to know each other, to develop their ideas, work together and prepare for theForum.

    "description": "Share2f This program is a collaboration of members of the East Africa Screen Collective (EASC) with DW Akademie on the program ”DW Akademie Film Development Fund”. The rationale for the EAccelerate Fund is to put management and program design of capacity building tools for the African screen sector into the hands of Africans and African organisations. It is a decolonising approach in rethinking financing and sectoral partnerships on the continent. With the conviction that the ownership of the program should lie in East Africa, the “DW Akademie Film Development Fund” will be merged into the “EAccelerate Fund” and managed by Documentary Africa (DocA) on behalf of the EASC. In 2024, the program will focus on supporting the alumni of the “DW Akademie Film Development Fund” through funding and training in the development of proof of concepts/short films from their previously developed projects. Call for Applications 2025 📣The EAccelerate Fund 2025 is now accepting applications from East African filmmakers looking to bring their short film ideas to life. This fund is designed to provide support, funding, and mentorship to filmmakers from East Africa to create high-quality short films with regional and international visibility. Selected teams will receive up to €20,000 in funding, alongside access to expert mentorship to develop their films from concept to completion. Additionally, selected films will have the opportunity for regional screenings, with a potential to screen internationally. Key Details:Director and Producer must both be East African. Open to filmmakers from Burundi, DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Comoros, Mauritius, or Madagascar. Films should not exceed 20 minutes in duration. 80% of the film must be shot in East Africa. The final film must be completed by December 1st, 2025. Selected films must be open to screening regionally or internationally. If you have a unique story to tell and a passion for filmmaking, apply today. GranteesThe East Africa Screen Collective (EASC) has chosen four East African filmmakers to receive up to €20,000 and personalized training from the EAccelerate Fund. The selected filmmakers are Neema Ngelime from Tanzania, Dilman Dila and Patience Nitumwesiga from Uganda, and Habtamu Gebrehiwot from Ethiopia. The Fund will support them to produce short films based on previously developed film ideas. For grantees without a producer, the program will facilitate connections to experienced professionals from the region.

    "description": "ShareThe Sterling Non-Oil Export Academy is an initiative by Sterling Bank designed to provide expert advisory services and hands-on training for exporters seeking to thrive in the non-oil export space — with the ultimate goal of accelerating Nigeria’s non-oil export growth. Designed as a convening ground for the entire export ecosystem; from established and aspiring exporters to regulators, financiers, aggregators, manufacturers, and logistics providers, the forum aims to spark bold conversations, build strategic connections, and chart a new course for Nigeria’s global trade ambitions. Export Academy 1 scaledThe Sterling Non-Oil Export Academy is an initiative by Sterling Bank designed to provide expert advisory services and hands-on training for exporters seeking to thrive in the non-oil export space — with the ultimate goal of accelerating Nigeria’s non-oil export growth. Nigeria stands at a pivotal crossroads in its economic evolution. With global trade expanding and demand rising for high-quality, diverse products from new markets, the country has an unprecedented opportunity to grow its non-oil export sector and reposition itself as a competitive global supplier. As of Q4 2024, Nigeria’s total merchandise trade reached ₦36. 6 trillion, with exports contributing over half of that at ₦20 trillion. However, crude oil continues to dominate this space, accounting for 68. Non-oil exports remain underutilized, contributing just 4. 2% of total export value. In light of volatile oil prices and shrinking oil revenues, expanding Nigeria’s non-oil export base is no longer optional; it is urgent. BenefitsIn response to this need, the academy will offer a comprehensive blend of hands-on training and tailored advisory services to both new and existing non-oil exporters. Participants will gain practical knowledge on export processes, compliance requirements, market access strategies, and financial planning — equipping them with the tools and insights needed to compete effectively in regional and global markets.

What Past Winners say\"I heard about Opportunity Desk from my friends and fellow volunteers, and after getting accepted into the Millennium Fellowship I turned on my notifications for OD on all social media platforms. I applied for the OD Impact Challenge last year and emerged second place which was a very remarkable experience for me. The cash prize and media features really helped my project and I went on to win the Global Changemakers Grant and was selected for participate in the Youth Summit in South Africa on a fully funded trip. I'm so grateful for all the doors winning ODIC has opened for me. \"Clinton Okechukwu2022 ODIC Runner-up\"I came into contact with Opportunity Desk on my quest of researching online to identify some organization with like minds of our on-going project. When I received an email telling me that I had qualified for the 30 under 30 changemaker, I was very excited and I felt that our project we used to apply has the impact on the society. Since then, taking advantage of the exposure that I received, I've been able to travel to the Eastern part of my country to train about 75 youth to acquire a skill in shoe making. Also, our project being awarded Africa Green Ambassador Award with was held in Nigeria by ACERPIN. \"Peter Anowie2022 ODIC Finalist\"Receiving the email that informed me that I had been selected as a changemaker under 30 was an incredibly moving moment for me.

Being a member of the Opportunity Desk community has allowed me to meet many other young entrepreneurs who share my passion for social impact. \"Nyake Yvette Cathy2022 ODIC Finalist\"The experience with Opportunity Desk has been enlightening and motivating.

It was not only a personal achievement but also a testament to the potential for positive change that lies within each of us. \"Aaron Elekwachi2022 ODIC Finalist\"I've been connected to Opportunity Desk for nothing less than 5 years and my experience with the platform has been nothing less than remarkable.

Impact Challenge changed everything since it made my Innovation and I more visible. After seeing my \"story of change,\" many people got in touch with me and wanted to work and partner with me.

Your passion, optimism and commitment to solve the world’s most pressing problems is an inspiration to everyone around the world. Selecting the top three was a very tough decision to make as all finalists were outstanding. They represent leaders and entrepreneurs who are taking great steps to solve real problems and add significant value to the lives of people in the communities. It is amazing to see the brilliant ideas and we are deeply moved by the commitment of young people to bringing about positive change in your community. Meet the Winners______________________________________________________________________________#1 First Place: Stanley Anigbogu ( Nigeria)- CEO & Founder, ArtechubsStanley Anigbogu is the founder of ArtecHubs Nigeria, which is a leading tech skill acquisition company for young minds in southeastern Nigeria. According to Stanley, well-intentioned mandatory education laws have put a strain on education in primary & secondary schools. As employers struggle to hire, they’ve added unrealistic qualifications & credentials to even the least entry-level jobs making it even harder for people without an education pedigree to find quality jobs. This inspired Stanley to create ArtecHubs; to equip young persons irrespective of financial capability or social strata for the future workforce either as start-up founders or employees with quality pay. ArtecHubs prepares young persons for the fourth industrial revolution and challenges them to become job creators rather than job seekers by equipping them with relevant skills needed for the future workforce and providing support systems for their growing start-ups. Unlike other skill acquisition companies /STEM hubs, ArtecHubs treats students inrural communities with utmost priority given the fear they have that they may not be able to withstand the competition from their folks who grew up in the urban areas with access to facilities like theirs. These do this through hands-on inclusive training sessions, Industry 4. 0 boot camps, and group community projects/exhibitions. #2 Second Place: Muhammad Iqhrammullah ( Indonesia)- Co-Leader, Co-EXAMPLE/Chemistry Department, UNSYIAHMuhammad Iqhrammullah is one of leading young scientists in Indonesia whose works cover various research topics in sustainability; ranging from heavy metal to citizen science. He has successfully developed renewable materials from biomass and bioresources. In 2020, he proposed a novel polycondensation mechanism of polyurethane prepared from green algae. His method offers a shortcut to the manufacturing of the material as it does not require polyol extraction. The polymeric materials he has prepared are used to control and monitor the heavy metal contamination in the water by using adsorptive removal and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy techniques, respectively. He is a part of a team, formerly led by Prof. Si, that received a grant from WWF Netherlands to conduct a citizen science project in Aceh Jaya Regency, Aceh Province, Indonesia. The project has been conducted for more than a year with an objective to empower the community in combating the mercury pollution. The area was infamous for the threat of mercury pollution released from the artisanal gold mining. The citizen science project helps the community to be aware of the dangers of mercury, by involving them in the pollution assessment. It has been successful in engaging various stakeholders (regent and provincial government agencies, gold miner, religious leaders, local leaders and youths) to end the use of mercury in the artisanal gold mining. #3 Babatunde Bale ( Nigeria)- Co-founder/Administrative Coordinator, The R. A InitiativeBabatunde Bale is an emerging Optometrist at the University of Benin, Nigeria. He is the co-founder of The R. A (Restoration of Eyecare Through Innovation and Awareness) Initiative. A non-profit organization that focuses on eradicating avoidable blindness in African communities.

I have also attended a lot of seminars and workshops through the opportunities shared by Opportunity Desk. Early 2020, we saw an opportunity on Opportunity Desk to apply for Global Giving. We did andparticipated in the acceleration program and received over $100 to make reusable cloth pads for women in the vulnerable situation; IDP Camp. More recently, I applied for Leap Africa program through Opportunity Desk and was selected. ”-Ngunan Ioron AlohoI found opportunity desk for the first time in 2017 when I was still home, looking for undergraduate scholarships so that I can further to university. Since then, I have been an ardent follower and user of the platform. I dream big, A LOT but most times, my immediate situation and environment always manage to shut my dreams down knowing that there’s no way I can afford things that I desire. However, opportunity desk represented the window out, a promise of the future for me. With numerous global opportunities to apply for and seeing testimonies of previous users, my hope began to build but with three years of consistent rejections, it was draining However in 2020, I had some close call to acceptances; finalist in One Young World Enterprise for peace scholarship, finalist for G(girls)20 to represent African Union, alternate selection for the Hanson Leadership Institute in San Diego and finally got selected to represent Nigeria at the Miss Career Africa 2020 Competition in Rwanda where I won the Miss Speaker Africa 2020 title. It was my first time travelling outside the country in a plane and the genesis of me launching my Forbidden Topics business. It took me three years to get this far. I learnt consistency, perseverance and global thinking via the platform and I am grateful to Opportunity desk for that. I always introduce young people to the platform every time I get speaking opportunities so that the cake can go round after all, the sky is big enough for all birds to fly. ”– Oluwadamilola AkinteweWe are proud of every applicant.
